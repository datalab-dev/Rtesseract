This is an R interface to the tesseract OCR system.
tesseract is available at https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/.

Installing tesseract involves first installing leptonica
http://www.leptonica.com/.

This is currently a very simple interface so that we can access
the results of the OCR and the associated confidence levels.

We can machine generate the interface to the other methods and classes.
