ocr() function using the API-level functions.

[Done] Plot the image and the components and 
*  show the confidence level for each 
   See tests/plot.R

  Annotate an SVG plot of this so that we can see the confidence levels and alternatives for a bbox.

Get alternatives via R interface to API, not the R_alternatives routine.

Get components - leptonica objects Boxa and Pixa

error rates and confusion matrix when know the actual values.


[Done] SetVariable and GetVariable.
     tests/vars.R
     different types.

[Basic] configuration

[Done] capabilities  - at configure time.
  e.g. image formats leptonica understands.
