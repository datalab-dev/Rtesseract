ocr() function using the API-level functions.

[Done] Plot the image and the components and 
*  show the confidence level for each 
   See tests/plot.R

  Annotate an SVG plot of this so that we can see the confidence levels and alternatives for a bbox.

When find an error, get the subset of the image for that bounding box and 
then see if we can cluster them.

error rates and confusion matrix when know the actual values.


Get alternatives via R interface to API, not the R_alternatives routine.


[low] Get components - leptonica objects Boxa and Pixa



[Done] SetVariable and GetVariable.
     tests/vars.R
     different types.

[Basic] configuration

[Done] capabilities  - at configure time.
  e.g. image formats leptonica understands.
