ocr() function using the API-level functions.

[Done] Plot the image and the components and 
*  show the confidence level for each 
   See tests/plot.R

  Annotate an SVG plot of this so that we can see the confidence levels and alternatives for a bbox.

When find an error, get the subset of the image for that bounding box and 
then see if we can cluster them.
  See inst/caseStudies

  Can do this from the bounding box information and reading the image using one of the  R packages.

[ok] error rates and confusion matrix when know the actual values.

[low] Get components - leptonica objects Boxa and Pixa


[Done] Get alternatives via R interface to API, not the R_tesseract_ alternatives routine.

[Done] When Recognize() not called, don't seg fault in lapply().




[Done] SetVariable and GetVariable.
     tests/vars.R
     different types.

[Basic] configuration

[Done] capabilities  - at configure time.
  e.g. image formats leptonica understands.
