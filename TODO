GetAlternatives
  Only returns one
  Segfaults.
  Look at the R_ocr_alternatives and see if we can reuse that code.
  Note that ocr(alternatives = TRUE) works.

compareWords() warns about different lengths. Something wrong. See MarkLundy/ocr.R
  Is this to be expected as the ocr and truth words may have different number of characters.
  Or think of other ways to compare them - adist?

cropToBoxes = TRUE in plot.OCR - get it to work.

ocr() function using the API-level functions.
   i.e. implement not in C but in R code to assemble the different pieces.

[Done] Plot the image and the components and 
*  show the confidence level for each 
   See tests/plot.R

  Annotate an SVG plot of this so that we can see the confidence levels and alternatives for a bbox.

When find an error, get the subset of the image for that bounding box and 
then see if we can cluster them.
  See inst/caseStudies

  Can do this from the bounding box information and reading the image using one of the  R packages.

[ok] error rates and confusion matrix when know the actual values.

[low] Get components - leptonica objects Boxa and Pixa


[Check] Get alternatives via R interface to API, not the R_tesseract_ alternatives routine.
   Is this in the ocr() routine? e.g. ocr(, alternatives = TRUE)


[Done] When Recognize() not called, don't seg fault in lapply().


[Done] SetVariable and GetVariable.
     tests/vars.R
     different types.

[Basic] configuration

[Done] capabilities  - at configure time.
  e.g. image formats leptonica understands.
   leptonicaImageFormats()

[Done] PrintVariables scan() problem.
